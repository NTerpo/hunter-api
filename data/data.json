It contains segments from the Acquis Communautaire, the body of European legislation, comprising all the treaties, regulations and directives adopted by the European Union (EU). Since each new country joining the EU is required to accept the whole Acquis Communautaire, this body of legislation has been translated into 24 official languages. For the 23rd official EU language, Irish, the Acquis is not translated on a regular basis; which is why DGT-TM includes only a small amount of data in Irish. The 2014 release of DGT-TM brought the translations for the 24th official language Croatian.",

The Common Questionnaire is not supported by a legal act, but is based on a gentlemen's agreement with the participating countries. Data displayed in this table cover the length of railway lines, whether electrified or not, on the territory of the reporting country. Railway lines are defined as a line of communication made up by rail exclusively for the use of railway vehicles. They consist of one or more adjacent running tracks forming a route between two points. Where a section of network comprises two or more lines running alongside one another, there are as many lines as routes to which tracks are allotted exclusively.",

To help citizens exercise this right, the Regulation stipulates that all 3 institutions must make a register of documents available online. This is why the Commission decided to set up a register that would initially contain a number of document types, with a focus on legislative documents: documents with references including COM, C et SEC and other types, including agendas and minutes of Commission meetings",
